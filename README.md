## 📜 Overview

This repository contains the **Frontend Application** for the **NeuroScan AI** project. It is a lightweight, interactive web dashboard built with **Streamlit** that serves as the user interface for our Brain Tumor Classification system.

This app acts as a client that communicates with a powerful, separate **AI Inference API**.

> ⚠️ **Important Note:** This repository is for the **UI only**. The core deep learning model, training logic, and the backend API are hosted in a separate repository.
